    "In the [DiffPy-CMI](http://www.diffpy.org/products/diffpycmi/) framework the [diffpy.srreal](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.srreal) package provides the majority of features for evaluation of structure models and for simulation of structure-based physical quantities.  The diffpy.srreal calculators address physical quantities deriving from atom-pair interactions.  The calculators use the same procedure for iteration over atom pairs and a uniform interface to structure data.  As a result, the package can be easily extended with user-defined calculators or with support for additional structure representations.\n",

    "- BondCalculator - evaluation of bond distances\n",
    "- BVSCalculator - evaluation of bond valence sums\n",
    "- OverlapCalculator - calculation of atom overlaps asumming hard-sphere model\n",
